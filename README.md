## Introduction:

> Project developed in the Python programming language to automate the commits and the upload of files to the Github working repository, using Git.

## Prerequisites:

> For Pusher operation, it is necessary to have the [hipposcraper](https://github.com/kai-dg/hipposcraper.git) installed.

## Installation:

> Do the following:
1. Change to the directory where you installed [hipposcraper](https://github.com/kai-dg/hipposcraper.git)
2. Clone [this](https://github.com/RedLyon1200/pusher.git) repository: https://github.com/RedLyon1200/pusher.git
3. Switch to the pusher directory (cd pusher/)
4. Running the installation file ./setup_pusher.sh

## Synopsis

'pusher \<option\> [files]'

## How to execute pusher?  

1. In order for pusher to obtain the task data, the first thing to do is to execute the command __tasker__, followed by the project URL of the intranet.hbtn.io (this step should only be performed once per project).
2. With the pusher command you must select one of the options listed below:
__-m:__ to upload files that are in a modified state.  
__-n:__ to upload newly created files or files that are not within the repository.  
__-a:__ to upload all files (new and changed). 
3. Optionally you can specify which file you want to upload, for example __*.py__, the default value when not specifying it is '*'
4. Tell the program if you want to modify the commits or leave the default value generated by the tasker.
5. Confirm whether you want to push files immediately or leave them for manual uploading with the git push command.
